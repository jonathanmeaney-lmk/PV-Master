                    her old colleague, John. John told Sandra that his car had <input class="input-up" type="text" id="story-two">

                    but he didn't want so spend too much money. Sandra told him he should

                    as there are some great deals.

                    PR business after his old company <input class="input-up" type="text" id="story-six"> 
                    last year. John and Sandra decided to <input class="input-up" type="text" id="story-seven"> 
                    a bar to have a drink and that’s when John offered Sandra a job with his new company. He was going to

                    Sandra asked him how his girlfriend, Tina, was doing and John told her that Tina 
                    had <input class="input-up" type="text" id="story-nine"> a bit of a hippy since she 
                    <input class="input-up" type="text" id="story-ten"> yoga a few months ago. That was a 
                    coincidence, Sandra said, because she had <input class="input-up" type="text" id="story-eleven"> 
                    yoga classes last week. Sandra had tried meditation classes for a few weeks but she wasn’t enjoying it so she 
                    decided to <input class="input-up" type="text" id="story-twelve"> and try yoga.

                    Sandra said she needed an activity to help her relax because she was feeling 
                    nervous since a thief had <input class="input-up" type="text" id="story-thirteen"> 
                    her house a few weeks ago. When they finished their coffees, 
                    John <input class="input-up" type="text" id="story-fourteen"> Sara’s new number and 
                    said he would call her to meet for another drink soon.
